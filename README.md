# Part1. Project Background
## 1.1Blockchain is the new digital technology following IT and the Internet.
### Since the advent of the Internet, the cost of information dissemination in human society has been significantly reduced. This leap in communication efficiency has unleashed tremendous productivity. However, traditional internet infrastructure primarily focuses on the efficiency of information transmission, while neglecting the confirmation of ownership and attribution of data. As a result, persistent and structural issues such as “naked data” and “orphaned information” have emerged. Some forms of information carry strong value attributes—for example, remittance and payment details—which still require third-party intermediaries to ensure security and trust. Consequently, the cost of value transfer remains high today.
### The emergence of blockchain technology offers a potential solution to this dilemma. With its open, transparent, tamper-resistant, and intermediary-free nature, blockchain enables secure, efficient, and low-cost value transfer. Humanity now has the opportunity to build a trustworthy, programmable value transmission network on top of blockchain technology. In the era of the value Internet, the cost of transferring value will be drastically lowered, once again unlocking significant productivity gains.
### Blockchain’s unique strengths—such as verified data ownership and efficient value transfer—make it applicable across various industries, including financial services, contract management, charitable causes, and the Internet of Things. In the years ahead, blockchain is poised to transform the landscape of many sectors. It is far from a marginal technology; rather, it has become a critical battleground in global technological competition. Much like how the Android operating system laid the foundation for the mobile ecosystem, blockchain is establishing the technological bedrock of the next-generation digital world.
### Throughout history, we’ve seen that foundational technologies first gain recognition, then evolve into widespread application. Blockchain is entering this next phase. “Decentralization” is the cornerstone of blockchain architecture, while “fairness, openness, and justice” represent the core values it embodies.
### Core technologies are the strategic assets of a nation. Blockchain is widely regarded as the next major IT wave following the Internet, and its applications are now rapidly advancing worldwide—from sparks to a raging wildfire.

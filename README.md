## 1.1 Blockchain is the new digital technology following IT and the Internet
### Since the advent of the Internet, the cost of information dissemination in human society has been significantly reduced. This leap in communication efficiency has unleashed tremendous productivity. However, traditional internet infrastructure primarily focuses on the efficiency of information transmission, while neglecting the confirmation of ownership and attribution of data. As a result, persistent and structural issues such as “naked data” and “orphaned information” have emerged. Some forms of information carry strong value attributes—for example, remittance and payment details—which still require third-party intermediaries to ensure security and trust. Consequently, the cost of value transfer remains high today.
### The emergence of blockchain technology offers a potential solution to this dilemma. With its open, transparent, tamper-resistant, and intermediary-free nature, blockchain enables secure, efficient, and low-cost value transfer. Humanity now has the opportunity to build a trustworthy, programmable value transmission network on top of blockchain technology. In the era of the value Internet, the cost of transferring value will be drastically lowered, once again unlocking significant productivity gains.
### Blockchain’s unique strengths—such as verified data ownership and efficient value transfer—make it applicable across various industries, including financial services, contract management, charitable causes, and the Internet of Things. In the years ahead, blockchain is poised to transform the landscape of many sectors. It is far from a marginal technology; rather, it has become a critical battleground in global technological competition. Much like how the Android operating system laid the foundation for the mobile ecosystem, blockchain is establishing the technological bedrock of the next-generation digital world.
### Throughout history, we’ve seen that foundational technologies first gain recognition, then evolve into widespread application. Blockchain is entering this next phase. “Decentralization” is the cornerstone of blockchain architecture, while “fairness, openness, and justice” represent the core values it embodies.
### Core technologies are the strategic assets of a nation. Blockchain is widely regarded as the next major IT wave following the Internet, and its applications are now rapidly advancing worldwide—from sparks to a raging wildfire.

## 1.2 Bottlenecks in Blockchain Development
### Blockchain technology has now entered the 3.0 era, making large-scale commercial applications theoretically possible. However, its limited data processing capacity still falls short of meeting the demands of high-frequency, large-scale use cases. In other words, constraints at the infrastructure level are hindering the full potential of upper-layer applications. While the vision is promising, realizing it will take considerable time. Fundamentally, the core issues facing blockchain today are its limited throughput and slow transaction finality.
### To address these challenges, the blockchain industry has been exploring several approaches:
#### 1）Larger block sizes: This involves increasing the storage capacity of each block. Bitcoin experimented with this approach—originally, each Bitcoin block had a 1MB limit. In late 2017, SegWit2x proposed increasing the block size to 2MB. However, due to security concerns, the SegWit2x hard fork was eventually canceled.
#### 2）Off-chain transactions: This method includes building solutions like the Lightning Network or sidechains outside the main chain to process transactions off-chain. Ethereum is actively pursuing this path. By locking up a certain amount of ETH or BTC as collateral, users can conduct off-chain transactions through alternative protocols or networks.
#### 3）Delegated consensus protocols: This involves selecting a group of super nodes to form a smaller consensus group. EOS, for instance, uses a "parliamentary-style" delegated consensus mechanism in which a limited number of nodes produce blocks and broadcast them to the entire network to achieve consensus.
### Despite these efforts, none of the three approaches has fully resolved the trade-offs between transaction speed, decentralization, and security. The inherent tension among these three dimensions continues to pose a bottleneck.
### The LORA public chain aims to address this challenge by developing a next-generation blockchain infrastructure that is highly scalable and compatible. Its mission is to help the industry move beyond proof-of-concept and toward true, large-scale commercial adoption.

## 1.3 Prospects for Blockchain Development
### Blockchain is widely regarded as the fourth fundamental technological revolution following the steam engine, electricity, and the internet. If steam engines and electricity once liberated physical productivity, and the internet reshaped the way information is transmitted, then blockchain—serving as the core engine for building trust mechanisms in the digital age—holds the potential to reshape the structure of production relations within the global digital economy.
### In the financial sector, especially in cross-border financial services, institutions have long faced high costs and complex processes for reconciliation, clearing, and settlement. With its inherent characteristics of traceability and immutability, blockchain technology significantly reduces inter-institutional reconciliation and dispute resolution costs, while improving the efficiency of payment processing—thus opening new channels for small-scale cross-border transactions. As early as December 2017, China Merchants Bank successfully completed the world’s first blockchain-based cross-border RMB interbank clearing transaction, marking a preliminary validation of blockchain’s feasibility in real-world financial applications.
### At its core, blockchain aims to solve two structural challenges of the digital age: first, the visibility of asset flows; and second, the low-cost construction of trust mechanisms. Unlike traditional economic systems where the circulation of physical money is often opaque and difficult to control, blockchain ensures that every transfer of value leaves a verifiable record on the chain. More importantly, blockchain enables trust to be established without the need for third-party intermediaries, profoundly transforming the foundations of modern credit systems.
### As Yang Yanchao, a researcher at the Intellectual Property Center of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, puts it: blockchain’s greatest significance lies in its ability to build a foundation of trust within an anonymous network environment—releasing unprecedented innovative potential. The technology is rapidly expanding into areas such as healthcare, education, philanthropy, and social governance. For instance, in the cultural industry, intellectual property protection has long been plagued by low copying costs, enforcement difficulties, and complex evidence requirements. Blockchain’s end-to-end rights confirmation and traceability mechanisms are now fundamentally reconstructing the trust foundation and business models of content industries.
### In summary, blockchain, as a forward-looking and general-purpose technological infrastructure, is demonstrating strong development momentum and cross-sector applicability. It is expected to profoundly impact global economic structures and production paradigms over the next decade.




# Part 2. The LORA Public Blockchain


## 2.1 Overview of the LORA Blockchain System
### LORA is a multi-chain, parallel blockchain network specifically designed for high-concurrency commercial applications. It aims to overcome the limitations of existing public chains in terms of performance, compatibility, and scalability. Built on the Tendermint cross-chain protocol and an optimized BFT consensus mechanism, LORA integrates distributed storage, smart contracts, and secure communication into a highly efficient infrastructure.
### Compared to traditional public chains, LORA retains foundational features such as immutability and peer-to-peer transmission, while adopting a modular design that separates the system into multiple functional subchains, such as a token chain and a data chain. It is also natively compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), significantly lowering the migration barrier for developers. Its unique parallel computing architecture substantially enhances on-chain transaction processing capabilities, reduces response times, and provides a stable and efficient runtime environment. This makes LORA well-suited for high-frequency application scenarios such as DeFi, the metaverse, and digital identity.
### LORA is designed to serve as the “infrastructure for the next generation of the value Internet,” offering a more open, compatible, and sustainable platform for global decentralized applications.

## 2.2 Public Blockchain Architecture
### LORA is optimized to handle high traffic, high concurrency, and cross-blockchain data and models, and builds its foundational system architecture accordingly. The stable operation of LORA requires a reliable, secure, scalable, and easily maintainable application system platform as its backbone.
### LORA divides the blockchain system into the following layers:
#### 1） User Service Layer
#### 2） Developer Service Layer
#### 3） On-Chain Service Layer
#### 4） Underlying Protocol Layer
### ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/911006fe-b519-44e1-8e1b-0db01ad1046d)

## 2.3 Project Design Philosophy of LORA
### The LORA team aims to build a distributed, production-grade open ecosystem for enterprise-level blockchain applications. It is committed to closely integrating blockchain technology with data applications, fully leveraging the advantages of blockchain to address the growing cost and security challenges posed by centralized systems in real-world application scenarios.
### LORA adopts the Tendermint cross-chain protocol and employs a 1+N parallel chain structure, static ledger, LRB space-time proof, dynamic storage, polymorphic nodes, node migration and elimination, and a PoS consensus mechanism. Based on the needs of commercial application systems, it provides an open-source IDE development environment to build a truly commercial-grade Blockchain 3.0 ecosystem.
### The Token Chain, i.e., the public chain's cryptographic token layer, acts as a decentralized digital carrier for payments based on blockchain technology. The encrypted LORA Token system enables peer-to-peer direct transactions, avoiding high fees and complex processes typically associated with centralized payments. All transactions must be validated by network nodes and permanently recorded on the public distributed ledger based on blockchain technology. The LORA Token is the most essential tool for enabling value transfer within the LORA ecosystem.

## 2.4 Technical Features of LORA
### A blockchain is a chain of data blocks generated using cryptographic methods. Each block contains multiple network transactions and is used to verify data validity (anti-counterfeit) and generate the next block. For ordinary users, it acts as a public ledger recording all transaction history; for developers, it functions as a distributed database. Key features include decentralization, openness, autonomy, and immutability. Blockchain is inherently suited to support decentralized applications (DApps), particularly in data storage.
### LORA adopts a 1+N multi-chain architecture, essentially comprising a public chain plus N sub-chains. These chains handle business logic and data partitioning rather than being physically isolated as public or private chains. The public chain is singular, while theoretically, there can be unlimited sub-chains. Each sub-chain can run one or more DApps. Using the latest sharding storage technology, the sub-chains support parallel transaction processing. Once transactions are completed, they are asynchronously written to the public chain ledger. This approach is one of the optimal solutions to mitigate network congestion.

## 2.5 Distributed Data System: Public Chain Technical Architecture
## 2.5.1 Protocol Layer
### The protocol layer represents the foundational level of blockchain technology. It maintains the network nodes and only provides APIs for interaction. Typically, an official lightweight client (commonly referred to as a wallet) is provided, enabling functions like address creation, signature verification, fund transfers, and balance inquiries. This layer builds the network environment, establishes transaction channels, and defines node reward rules.
### From a technical perspective, the protocol layer includes four major components: network programming, distributed algorithms, cryptographic signature technologies, and data storage. Network programming capability is the main factor in selecting a development language. Distributed algorithms can be implemented in any language as they are tied to business logic. Signature and storage technologies are largely plug-and-play. The real complexity lies in implementing peer-to-peer networks and handling concurrency. Technologies like distributed algorithms and cryptographic signatures are employed during the P2P implementation process.

## 2.5.2 SOLIDITY-Compatible Virtual Machine Extension Layer
### The Solidity extension layer enables smart contracts based on Ethereum’s EVM, often referred to as “programmable contracts” or “intelligent contracts.” These contracts are designed to auto-execute when certain conditions are met, such as auto-transferring securities or funds.
### There are no strict technological constraints at this layer—technologies such as distributed storage, machine learning, VR, IoT, and big data can be integrated. Developers have the freedom to use any programming language, independent of the protocol layer. Aside from interaction with the protocol layer during transactions, development on this layer should remain separate. This layer is closer to the application layer and can be seen as the server-side (Server) in a B/S architecture, whereas the protocol layer functions more like infrastructure. This layered design reduces blockchain data load, increases network independence, and enables flexible, unconstrained development.

## 2.5.3 Application Layer
### The application layer provides the user-facing interface—products that ordinary users interact with directly. It can be seen as the client-side (Browser) in the B/S model. It facilitates the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology. Typical examples include lightweight wallets. Programming languages for this layer may include C++, JLorScript, Python, Go, etc.

## 2.5.4 Consensus Layer
### This layer encompasses consensus algorithms and mechanisms that enable widely distributed nodes to efficiently agree on the validity of data blocks in a decentralized blockchain network. It is a core technology of blockchain and serves as an effective mechanism for community governance.
### LORA adopts a hybrid consensus mechanism based on a honeycomb node network and round-robin verification, offering scalability superior to that of the Lightning Network. The public chain utilizes a multi-layer structure combining the Token Chain and parallel chains to meet the high concurrency and interactivity demands of Web3.0-era DApp ecosystems.
### The Token Chain is built on a hybrid of PoS + BFT optimal algorithms, multi-chain heterogeneous data incentive layers, and a proof-of-importance mechanism. Its consensus layer is composed of multiple parallel chains with different consensus mechanisms based on specific business requirements, forming a 1+N multi-chain structure that addresses the challenges of scalability and performance in public chains.
### Token Chains and multi-layer data chains are divided based on logic and data storage requirements and interact via the SEC gateway. This multi-chain structure overcomes the technical bottlenecks and the "blockchain trilemma" inherent in traditional single-chain models, significantly accelerating transaction confirmations and reducing resource consumption in public ledgers, thereby supporting large-scale data throughput.

## 2.5.4.1 Validators
### In classical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) algorithms, all nodes have equal weight. In Tendermint, nodes are assigned non-negative voting power, and those with substantial voting power are called validators. Validators participate in the consensus protocol by broadcasting cryptographic signatures, voting, or agreeing on the next block.
### Voting power can be predefined or dynamically modified by the blockchain based on the application logic. For instance, in PoS applications like the Midas Hub, voting power may be determined by the amount of tokens staked. Fractions like 2/3 or 1/3 refer to proportions of total voting power, not total validators, unless all validators have equal weight. “>2/3” means “more than two-thirds,” while “≥1/3” means “one-third or more.”

## 2.5.4.2 Tendermint Consensus
### Tendermint is a partially synchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol derived from the DLS algorithm.
### It is known for simplicity, high performance, and fork accountability. It requires a fixed and known set of validators, each identifiable by public keys. Validators attempt to reach consensus on a proposed block containing a series of transactions. In each round, a proposer is selected to initiate a block. Validators then vote in phases to accept the block or move to the next round. Proposers are selected from the validator set based on weighted voting rights.
### Tendermint uses over-two-thirds majority voting and a locking mechanism to ensure safety, similar to delegated PoS. To compromise safety, malicious actors must control more than one-third of voting power and issue multiple conflicting votes.
### If a group of validators compromises safety or attempts to do so, the protocol can identify them by tracking conflicting blocks and problematic votes.
### Tendermint combines strong security with excellent performance. Written in Rust for high-efficiency smart contracts, it can process thousands of transactions per second in a globally distributed network (e.g., 64-bit nodes across seven data centers on five continents), with order submission delays of only 1–2 seconds. Remarkably, even in hostile environments—validator crashes or malicious votes—it maintains high transaction throughput.

## 2.5.5 Incentive Layer
### This layer utilizes extended chain storage technology, storing private key signatures and base data on auxiliary chains. When users upload large files, the chain-linked data storage network automatically searches for nodes to form a new P2P network. This ensures data integrity while enabling ownership confirmation, thereby enhancing both storage and access security.

## 2.5.6 Extended P2P Protocol
### Scalability addresses the issue of blockchain data silos. We regard upgrades and forks as essential evolutionary mechanisms. Forks result in one main chain and several sub-chains. Technically, main and sub-chains are equal peers, distinguished only by consensus-defined identifiers. Each sub-chain can be tailored for specific business applications. By constructing a VEP (Value Exchange Protocol) between sub-chains—functioning like gateways—they can exchange data and value.
### This collaborative structure enables a multi-application blockchain ecosystem. Additionally, off-chain online data can be integrated into the LORA ecosystem, and with smart contract support, real-world events can trigger on-chain responses.

## 2.5.7 Homogeneous Cross-Chain Mechanism
### Traditional blockchain networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are based on a single-chain architecture, where all transactions and state transitions occur on a single ledger. This structure has the advantage of simplicity in both transaction processing and consensus mechanisms, which was sufficient in the early stages of blockchain development. However, as the technology has evolved and market demands have grown, the limitations of the single-chain design have become increasingly evident:
#### · Throughput and performance bottlenecks: For example, Bitcoin supports only ~7 transactions per second (TPS) and requires six block confirmations for finality. Ethereum has a block interval of 10–20 seconds. These constraints significantly hinder the scalability needed for growing blockchain use cases.
#### · Intra-chain business interference: In a single-chain system, heavy traffic in one application domain can congest the entire network, delaying otherwise normal transactions and confirmations.
#### · Isolated architecture: Single chains lack native mechanisms for inter-chain communication, limiting their ability to support cross-platform business interactions.
### To overcome these challenges, LORA adopts a multi-chain architecture based on the Tendermint consensus protocol.
### LORA introduces a parallel multi-mainchain model, where multiple main chains can be instantiated, each dedicated to a specific business domain. These chains operate independently but remain loosely coupled, leveraging parallel processing for enhanced performance. To handle procedural blocks, LORA employs a data archiving mechanism that archives expired data into historical storage, further improving system efficiency.
### This multi-chain structure not only supports various business types and operational models, but also ensures high performance. Cross-chain consensus enables both data auditing and value interoperability. Given the diversity of real-world business needs, a single-chain structure is inherently inadequate. In contrast, LORA assigns each business scenario to an independent chain focused on a minimal, cohesive set of functions. This not only enhances security but also ensures efficient use of computational and storage resources.
### For instance, compute-intensive, I/O-intensive, and hybrid applications can each run on purpose-built subchains, optimized for their respective characteristics. Applications requiring higher security and strict consistency—such as banking services—can be isolated to operate on the most secure layer of the architecture.

## 2.5.8 Heterogeneous / Relay-Based Flexible Cross-Chain Mechanism
### To enable seamless communication between different blockchain systems, LORA implements a general-purpose flexible cross-chain mechanism, powered by coordinated smart contracts, asynchronous communication protocols, state machines, and hash time-lock technology. This mechanism ensures interoperability of digital assets and value across internal and external blockchain environments, while maintaining consensus integrity and trustless value transfer.
### LORA’s cross-chain strategy comprises two components:
#### 1） Interoperability with external chains: Communication between LORA and external blockchains is achieved via a universal smart contract interface that adapts to the unique characteristics of external chains. Through state-machine-driven asynchronous operations, LORA supports secure and flexible interactions with heterogeneous networks.
#### 2） Internal interoperability between LORA-based chains: Within the LORA ecosystem, cross-chain communication is supported by more complex smart contracts and relay chains that coordinate the exchange between various LORA-native subchains or external chains. These relay chains act as intermediaries to bridge networks with differing architectures or consensus models.
### Cross-chain transactions serve as a trustless messaging protocol across blockchain networks, forming a critical infrastructure layer for inter-chain communication. Typically, a cross-chain transaction originates on a source chain and is transmitted via bridges and relay networks before reaching the destination chain. To incentivize participants in this transmission process, transaction initiators must pay fees in LRB, LORA’s native token, ensuring proper economic incentives for relayers and validators at each hop.
### LORA implements a cross-chain adapter layer, which generates compatible block headers to facilitate consensus and state verification across chains.
### To accommodate varying block generation speeds across different chains, LORA introduces a hierarchical sidechain mechanism. Chains are categorized into tiers based on their block times, and each tier is supported by a dedicated adapter chain or module. This design ensures time-aligned cross-chain transactions and avoids mismatches due to inconsistent block intervals.

## 2.5.9 LORA Sidechain Architecture
## 2.5.9.1 SideChain
### ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1a5707c-a34b-44e8-bcdd-a940725a58ab)
### Pegged Sidechain Technology Pegged Sidechains enable the transfer of digital assets across multiple blockchain networks. This allows users to access new cryptocurrency ecosystems while continuing to use their existing assets and applications. With pegged sidechains, users can participate in emerging blockchain systems without having to convert or abandon their original holdings, greatly enhancing system compatibility and user experience.
### A sidechain is a specialized blockchain that utilizes Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) pegging technology to enable asset transfers between blockchains. This mechanism empowers users to interact with new crypto environments using assets from their original blockchain. It also addresses long-standing concerns with the token incentive layer’s resistance to innovation—developers can simply create a new sidechain, connect it to the base system, and inherit or reuse the original chain’s functionalities. This avoids issues like liquidity shortages or excessive volatility typically associated with launching new tokens.
### Moreover, since sidechains operate as relatively independent and isolated systems, critical issues occurring within one sidechain are unlikely to affect the main chain or other sidechains. This significantly reduces systemic risk and operational costs.

## 2.5.9.2 Origin of Sidechains
### The term sidechain does not refer to a specific blockchain. Instead, it refers to any blockchain that adheres to a sidechain protocol. This designation is used in contrast to a “main chain,” or the original blockchain in a given ecosystem.

## 2.5.9.3 Definition of Sidechain Protocol
### A sidechain protocol is a system that allows tokens from the native main chain to be securely transferred to another blockchain—and back again—without compromising the security or integrity of the system. In essence, it enables two-way pegging (2WP) between the main chain and sidechains.
### This protocol has substantial implications. Any blockchain, including competing systems like Ethereum, can theoretically function as a sidechain—so long as it complies with the pegging protocol. This means the native token is no longer confined to its own blockchain but can circulate freely across multiple chains, greatly expanding its utility and market reach.
### As a result, developers and innovators can build diverse applications that integrate with the native blockchain by simply conforming to the sidechain protocol. This strengthens the position and network effect of the main chain while promoting a broader ecosystem of interoperable services.
### ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95b00386-973f-4e8e-bcbb-c31b66e906c1)

Two-Way Pegging is divided into the following stages:

## 2.5.9.4 Send Locking Transaction
### Lock the native transaction data on the main chain.
### Operation by the Native Token Holder,The token holder sends a special transaction to lock the tokens on the blockchain.
### ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aee87ac5-b64e-492d-87b6-d93d6cf2c305)

## 2.5.9.5 Pegged Sidechain Protocol:
### ➢ Wait for a Confirmation Period
#### The purpose of the confirmation period is to wait for the locking transaction to be confirmed by more blocks, which can prevent counterfeit locking transactions and denial-of-service attacks. The typical waiting time is 1-2 days.
### ➢ Redeem Native Token on the Sidechain
#### After the confirmation period ends, the user creates a transaction on the sidechain spending the output of the locking transaction and provides an SPV proof of work, outputting to their address on the sidechain. This transaction is called the redemption transaction, and the SPV proof of work refers to the proof of work for the block containing the redemption transaction.
### ➢ Wait for a Competition Period
#### The purpose of the competition period is to prevent double-spending. During this period:
##### (1) The redemption transaction will not be included in a block.
##### (2) New bitcoins transmitted to the sidechain cannot be used.
##### (3) If a larger proof of work appears, i.e., the redemption transaction includes an SPV proof with a higher difficulty than the Bitcoin main chain, the previous redemption transaction will be replaced.

## 2.5.9.6 Role of Sidechains
### Sidechains can enable blockchain systems to achieve better performance and privacy protection. They can also be extended to support various assets, such as stocks, bonds, and currencies in both the real world and virtual worlds. Additionally, sidechains can add functionalities such as smart contracts, secure processing, and real-world property registration. Sidechains can also have other sidechains for micropayments. They can be used for experiments with pre-release versions of future sidechains or for testing versions of Bitcoin.

## 2.5.9.7 Current Technology: Complete Script vs. Sidechains
### A notable highlight of large public blockchain systems is their script engines. Based on a complete script engine, it is possible to implement not only basic transfer functions but also multi-signature, collateral, betting data, and other smart contract applications. However, for security and implementation difficulty reasons, the script systems of the first-generation blockchain systems were designed to be relatively simple with many limitations. For example, they did not support loops, the script length was limited, and only a few standard types of transactions were supported.
### Taking Ethereum as an example of the second-generation blockchain systems, its main feature is the construction of an extended smart contract layer, which significantly enhances the script engine’s functionality. It added new instructions for reading the blockchain, billing, and jumping, and removed restrictions on stack memory, function call depth, and script length. Its scripting language is essentially Turing-complete, allowing developers to implement almost any functionality expressible in mathematical terms.
### Since Ethereum, extended scripts have become a popular way to build decentralized development platforms. However, one major drawback of this approach is that both the application code and the data generated by the application reside on the same blockchain, causing rapid blockchain expansion. Ethereum has attempted to mitigate this by optimizing and compressing blocks and transactions, but this is only a temporary solution.
### In addition, applications based on scripts share the same ledger, meaning parameters like block generation time cannot be customized, which undoubtedly limits the personalization of applications.
### ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c047fd91-53b8-4629-b3ba-1b6c36feb5e7)

### The sidechain mechanism achieves scalability through another dimension, where each sidechain runs on a different distributed node network, with independent audiences, investors, and development teams. This natural shard solution not only solves the blockchain expansion issue but also allows each application to have a personalized ledger. Its consensus mechanism, block parameters, and transaction types can all be customized, so we believe sidechains are a more cost-effective, flexible, and user-friendly solution compared to complete transaction scripts.

## 2.5.10 Flexible Support for Business Applications
### LORA achieves ease of use through two main aspects. The first is providing a Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) system to lower the usage threshold for businesses and individuals. Through network forking, data customization, smart contract deployment and upgrades, asset transaction monitoring, and supplemented with visualization features, blockchain applications become simple and easy to use. It also offers multi-language support, from Lua and C++ to J-LOR, enabling developers from different platforms to conveniently develop applications.

## 2.5.11 Open-source Graphene Technology
### In response to Ethereum's inefficient transmission speed and the information silos existing between public blockchains, each public blockchain has proposed its own scalability and cross-chain solutions, but the actual implementation has not been ideal. Many public blockchains have not launched as scheduled. For example, the most popular public blockchain in 2018, EOS, claimed to reach millions of TPS, but the actual TPS in operation was only about 3000. However, the actual TPS of LORA has reached 39,000+, and it is expected to grow exponentially in the future. How did LORA achieve this? LORA is based on the excellent open-source Graphene technology and BFT optimization algorithms, transforming the confirmation of transaction behavior into the confirmation of algorithmic proof, which theoretically increases efficiency by 20 times. LORA inherits the mature architecture, performance, and other technical advantages from Graphene. The main technical advantages of Graphene include: supporting a transaction throughput capacity of 10,000+ TPS, and an average transaction confirmation delay of seconds.

## 2.5.12 Sharding Technology
### LORA introduces Sharding technology, supporting horizontal scalability, and combines network sharding with transaction sharding. It also provides Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) to developers, offering rich BaaS APIs, data transaction APIs, and native APIs for developing blockchain applications.
### By adopting the POS consensus protocol, along with the advanced open-source Graphene solution and sharding technology, LORA achieves scalability and cross-chain goals. In most current operating environments, TPS has reached 39,000+.
### LORA provides an advanced and stable cross-chain underlying public blockchain, with the Internet of Things (IoT) and SWAP being the first applications on LORA.

# Part 3. Security Protection of LORA Technology and Network


## 3.1 Inherent Security Advantages of Blockchain
### Today, hackers are capable of disrupting entire networks, tampering with data, or luring careless users into security traps. They steal and misuse identity information, and by attacking centralized databases and exploiting single points of failure, they trigger various other security threats. However, the data storage and sharing model in blockchain technology is fundamentally different from current approaches to information security. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum use the same cryptographic technologies to ensure secure transactions, and blockchain has now become a tool for defending against security attacks and threats. The main advantages of blockchain in information security include:
#### · Ensuring data integrity through highly redundant databases
#### · Using cryptographic principles for data validation, ensuring immutability
#### · Employing multi-key access control mechanisms for permission management
#### · All transaction data on the blockchain is accompanied by digital signatures, making it tamper-proof
#### · Leveraging blockchain's security strengths to develop multi-level security applications
### CertCoin, developed by MIT, may be the first blockchain-based Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) application. PKI is a common form of public-key cryptography used to protect emails, messaging apps, websites, and other forms of communication. However, because most PKI systems rely on centralized trusted third-party Certificate Authorities (CAs) to issue, revoke, and manage key pairs for each participant, hackers can impersonate users to infiltrate encrypted communications. CertCoin eliminates the centralized authority, using blockchain as a distributed ledger to distribute public keys, thereby significantly reducing the risk of single-point intrusion.
### There are also examples in the field of certification, such as the government-certified Factom system. It builds a chain-structured storage system based on blockchain, decomposing certification into three parts: proof of existence, procedural proof, and auditability. This three-step process ensures data security and regulatory compliance in the handling of any digital asset certification.

## 3.2 LORA Security Protection
## 3.2.1 Securing Edge Devices with Identity Authentication
### As IT shifts its focus toward data and connectivity with “smart” edge devices, security must also adapt. While expanding the network can improve IT efficiency, productivity, and reduce power consumption, it also presents new security challenges for CISOs, CIOs, and entire organizations. Many companies are exploring the use of blockchain to secure IoT and Industrial IoT (IIoT) devices—because blockchain technology can enhance identity verification, improve data traceability and fluidity, and assist in record management.

## 3.2.2 Enhancing Confidentiality and Data Integrity
### Although blockchain was originally designed without specific access control mechanisms (due to its public distribution nature), some blockchain implementations are now addressing issues of confidentiality and access control. In an era where data can be easily tampered with or forged, ensuring confidentiality and integrity is undoubtedly a major challenge. However, the fully encrypted nature of blockchain data ensures that it cannot be accessed by unauthorized parties, while still retaining fluidity (making man-in-the-middle attacks nearly impossible).
### This data integrity also extends to IoT and IIoT. For example, IBM offers the option to manage IoT data with a private blockchain ledger on its Watson IoT platform, a feature already integrated into IBM Cloud services. Ericsson’s Blockchain Data Integrity service provides app developers working on General Electric’s Predix PaaS platform with fully auditable, compliant, and trusted data.

## 3.2.3 Protecting Private Messages
### LORA is using blockchain to protect private information circulating in real-time messaging tools and social media. Unlike end-to-end encryption used in apps like WhatsApp and iMessage, LORA protects user metadata through blockchain. Since metadata is randomly distributed on the ledger with no single point of collection, it is immune to hacking.




# Part 4. Introduction to LORA’s Advantages


## 4.1 LORA’s Advantages
## 4.1.1 Technical Advantages
### LORA is a blockchain-based data value ecosystem tailored for the era of big data. Its core objective is to establish a blockchain network that enables efficient, secure, and incentive-driven data exchange and value extraction. Current data transactions face four major pain points: data resource waste, data silos, data stagnation, and mismatches between data supply and demand. LORA addresses these challenges by constructing a community network oriented by demand, rewarding data contribution, and structuring data through segmentation. This enables the creation of a secure, efficient, traceable, and development-friendly data transaction platform. By combining blockchain networks with the needs of data value mining and exchange, LORA’s architecture follows these foundational principles:
### ✓ Trustworthy Transaction History: All trusted transaction records are permanently stored on the blockchain, enabling low-cost trust between trading parties, while ensuring reliability and privacy, and eliminating data stagnation caused by intermediaries.
### ✓ Incentive-Compatible Economic System: The design encourages nodes to publish data and supports the discovery of derivative value through data development, fostering ecosystem growth and reducing exchange costs.
### ✓ Granular Trading Mechanism: The system supports increasingly refined data asset transactions through well-designed network mechanisms.
### ✓ Market-Driven Data Pricing: LORA ensures fine-grained, market-oriented pricing of data via built-in economic models.
### ✓ High-Throughput Transactions: Capable of handling high-frequency data exchanges, with lab-tested performance exceeding one million TPS and 39,523 TPS in real network environments. This supports future large-scale data collection, edge computing result exchanges for AI, IoT, and robotics.
### ✓ Data Quality Validation: LORA supports automated validation through sampling, cross-checking, format and type recognition, and range detection, thereby ensuring secure transactions while offering configurable data quality checks.
### ✓ Support for Derivative Data Services: Enables programmable modeling of data, allowing developers to use general-purpose languages to build advanced analytical tools, integrate with LORA, and access Oracle networks for extended smart contract functionality.
### ✓ Cross-Chain Blockchain Services: Supports the integration of mature blockchain services in storage and computation to enhance LORA's service capabilities.

## 4.1.2 Enhancing and Replacing PKI
### Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is widely used to secure emails, messaging apps, websites, and other forms of digital communication. However, traditional PKI implementations rely on centralized Certificate Authorities (CAs) to issue, revoke, and manage key pairs, which opens vulnerabilities for cybercriminals to intercept encrypted communications or impersonate identities.
By distributing public keys via blockchain, LORA eliminates the risk of forged keys and enables verifiable identity communication. It is the first blockchain-based PKI system to entirely forgo centralized authorities, instead using the blockchain as a public, auditable, and fault-tolerant key registry. This allows transactions to be signed using identities generated by citizens on-chain.

## 4.1.3 Network-Layer Access Control
### The LORA public blockchain allows unrestricted node participation, and its network layer does not natively record user identities. While this suits open systems, it poses risks in high-stakes industries like finance.
When applied to the financial sector, LORA’s implementation must evaluate whether a public chain is necessary and include mechanisms for node identity registration. Additionally, VPNs, firewalls, and physical network isolation must be employed to protect miner nodes and ensure secure infrastructure.

## 4.1.4 Secure Network Transmission
### LORA emphasizes strong resistance to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks as a critical aspect of its secure transmission protocol.
A MITM attack involves an adversary intercepting and controlling communications between two parties, who mistakenly believe they are in direct, private contact.
To prevent this, LORA-compatible digital wallets must scan all digital certificates for validity, verify network proxy settings, and maintain a secure baseline for communications.

## 4.1.5 High Throughput
### Blockchains inherently feature distributed ledgers with consensus mechanisms, but not parallel processing. For instance, Bitcoin handles only 7 TPS and Ethereum around 15 TPS.
### To maintain data consistency and prevent Byzantine faults, most blockchains operate serially in key processes.
### Through extensive testing, LORA’s AurumOxProtocol utilizes the BOE (Balance of Execution) technology to enable high-frequency, dual-directional netting confirmations off-chain. With a processing speed exceeding 39,000 TPS—over 10 times faster than EOS—LORA outpaces most blockchain systems in transaction speed and reliability. The BOE mechanism meets the demands of large-scale throughput, and further integration with off-chain mechanisms can elevate performance even more.

## 4.2 Technical Analysis of LORA
### Developing enterprise applications using blockchain technology requires stepping beyond conventional blockchain frameworks. It necessitates rethinking architecture from the ground up, with enterprise needs as the guiding principle—rather than clinging to traditional distinctions between public and consortium chains.
### True innovation lies in combining blockchain's intrinsic strengths with enterprise application demands. Only by doing so can blockchain truly solve real-world problems at their root.

## 4.2.1 In-Depth Technical Analysis of LORA
### LORA integrates a variety of cutting-edge blockchain technologies along with its own proprietary architecture, aiming to build a large-scale commercial data application system and become a pioneer and leader in future blockchain development. It leverages a 1+N multi-chain architecture, POS consensus, CSL ledger and dynamic storage technology, polymorphic nodes, multi-consensus parallel mechanisms, secure sandbox environments, domestically developed IDEs, and several other advanced technical features.

## 4.2.2 1+N Parallel Cross-Chain Architecture
### The core of LORA's parallel cross-chain architecture consists of a public chain, parallel chains, and subchains. These components are designed for business logic and data partitioning rather than physical separation between public and private chains. There is only one public chain, while the number of parallel and subchains can be theoretically infinite. Each chain can operate one or more DApps. The parallel chains adopt the latest sharding and storage technologies to enable concurrent transaction processing, which are then asynchronously written to the public chain ledger—this is one of the most effective approaches to mitigate network congestion.

## 4.2.3 DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
### DAG is one of the core underlying data structures used in LORA. It addresses the technical bottlenecks and limitations of traditional blockchain structures by significantly enhancing transaction confirmation speed and reducing the resource burden on the public ledger. LORA adopts a hybrid Chain + DAG structure to ensure compatibility across both the public chain and subchains.

## 4.2.4 CSL Ledger and Dynamic Storage Technology
### CSL stands for Classified Static Ledger, which divides the LORA ledger into distinct types such as asset ledger, transaction ledger, application ledger, and log ledger. Both the public and subchains maintain their own ledgers. Among them, the asset, transaction, and log ledgers are immutable, while the application ledger can be updated and upgraded dynamically based on consensus mechanisms such as POS.

## 4.2.5 Data Layer Storage Technology
### The ledger storage layer adopts a distributed file system similar to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). IPFS is a next-generation distributed storage and sharing technology that integrates multiple advanced internet technologies. At its core, IPFS is a content-addressed peer-to-peer hypermedia distribution protocol, which forms a distributed file system within IPFS nodes (i.e., LORA data nodes).
### By maintaining a distributed hash table, IPFS enables unified storage and distribution of LORA's ledgers. This peer-to-peer protocol allows the LORA network to operate more efficiently, securely, and openly. IPFS supports high concurrency and large-scale simultaneous transactions, which are subsequently committed to the asset and log ledgers through the consensus mechanism.

## 4.2.6 POS (Proof of Stake) Mechanism
### While POW is a chain-based consensus and POS is block-based, the integration of both requires further research. Currently, POS appears more suitable for LORA. However, achieving large-scale commercial applications still requires improvements. Even when processing small data flows, a main chain in the data industry requires high I/O performance. Under the POS model, computational power is not the bottleneck—network bandwidth often is.
### Assuming each node has 100 Mbps bandwidth and each transaction is 100 bytes, with transmission and synchronization doubling the data size, the theoretical throughput is approximately 65,536 transactions per second (TPS). At 1 Gbps, the throughput reaches ~650,000 TPS; at 10 Gbps, ~6.5 million TPS. Given that modern data centers support up to 10 Gbps throughput, LORA’s POS-based system can theoretically achieve million-level TPS performance.

## 4.2.7 Polymorphic Nodes
### To meet the requirements of its cross-chain architecture and CSL ledger design, LORA adopts a polymorphic node structure. This approach enables rapid consensus on block transactions while reducing operational costs. LORA nodes are divided into three types: consensus nodes, data nodes, and standard nodes, each serving different roles in the network.

## 4.2.8 Lightning Network
### To address the performance limitations of standard user nodes, LORA introduces a scalable network model to support million-level TPS on its high-speed public chain. Based on its 1+N multi-chain structure, LORA retains unified token interoperability on the main chain, while supporting distinct transaction models for different types of data through mechanisms like a routable Lightning Network.
### For example, a blockchain game running on LORA might process individual actions as grouped transactions. Instead of recording every single operation on the main chain, only the start and end transactions are submitted, while intermediate processes are handled by middleware or off-chain components. This model reduces the burden on the main chain by offloading operations to subchains or parallel chains. The Lightning Network itself can handle over 100,000 transactions per second, and with parallel chains supporting similar capacity, the entire system's theoretical throughput under the 1+N architecture can reach up to 1 million TPS.

## 4.2.9 LORA Code Architecture Design

### · Consensus Client
### · Secure Sandbox
### · State Machine
### · LORA Service Nodes

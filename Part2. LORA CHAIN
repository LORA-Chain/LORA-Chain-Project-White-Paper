# Part 2. The LORA Public Blockchain

## 2.1 Overview of the LORA Blockchain System
### LORA is a multi-chain, parallel blockchain network specifically designed for high-concurrency commercial applications. It aims to overcome the limitations of existing public chains in terms of performance, compatibility, and scalability. Built on the Tendermint cross-chain protocol and an optimized BFT consensus mechanism, LORA integrates distributed storage, smart contracts, and secure communication into a highly efficient infrastructure.
### Compared to traditional public chains, LORA retains foundational features such as immutability and peer-to-peer transmission, while adopting a modular design that separates the system into multiple functional subchains, such as a token chain and a data chain. It is also natively compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), significantly lowering the migration barrier for developers. Its unique parallel computing architecture substantially enhances on-chain transaction processing capabilities, reduces response times, and provides a stable and efficient runtime environment. This makes LORA well-suited for high-frequency application scenarios such as DeFi, the metaverse, and digital identity.
### LORA is designed to serve as the “infrastructure for the next generation of the value Internet,” offering a more open, compatible, and sustainable platform for global decentralized applications.

## 2.2 Public Blockchain Architecture
### LORA is optimized to handle high traffic, high concurrency, and cross-blockchain data and models, and builds its foundational system architecture accordingly. The stable operation of LORA requires a reliable, secure, scalable, and easily maintainable application system platform as its backbone.
### LORA divides the blockchain system into the following layers:
#### User Service Layer
#### Developer Service Layer
#### On-Chain Service Layer
#### Underlying Protocol Layer
